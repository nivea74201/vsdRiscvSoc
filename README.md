vsdRiscvChipTapeOut
This repository contains the complete set of tasks, projects, and documentation developed during the Workshop on India’s RISC-V Program (Cohort 2).
The program’s aim is to provide practical, hands-on exposure to RISC-V architecture, toolchains, simulators, and open-source design workflows.
Through this initiative, participants progress towards the design, verification, and final tape-out of a reference RISC-V chip fabricated using the SCL180 (180nm CMOS) process by the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), India.
