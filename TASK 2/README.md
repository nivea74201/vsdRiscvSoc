This repository contains all assignments, implementations, and documentation completed as part of the Workshop on India's RISC-V Program (Cohort 2).
The primary goal of this program is to develop practical skills in RISC-V architecture, cross-compilation, ISA decoding, and simulation workflows, while gaining exposure to open-source SoC design methodologies.
The workshop culminates in the design, functional verification, and preparation for tape-out of a reference RISC-V processor on the SCL180 (180 nm CMOS) process node at the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), India.
